# Learn With 22One

This is a project designd to create a platform to foster sport education.
In Malawi, sports education is an art that has been given little to no attention. This is the challenge embraced by this project.

The objective is to create a repository of courses that can be followed both online or offline.
Based on this definition it is apparent that a learning management system has to be created. 
The initiative therefore seeks to create an in-house LMS that can easily be scaled up or down based on requirements.
Inspired by the Udacity Classrooms setup, this project seeks to provide a similar intuitive user experience.
SCORM Compliance is a key consideration factor.
Analytics are to be used to give statistical and measurable substance to the whole project.
